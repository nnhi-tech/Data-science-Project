These values reinforce the observation that the predicted distribution, like the original, shows minimal divergence from uniformity.\n",

Subsequently, the `kl_divergences()` function computes KL divergences between empirical distributions derived from sequences generated by a Markov model and an equilibrium distribution across various lengths."

        "* At lengths of 100, 1000, and 10,000, the KL divergence continues to decrease significantly, reaching values as low as $0.00045$, which implies that the initial distribution closely resembles the stationary distribution after many transitions.\n",

        "The results confirm that regardless of the initial distribution chosen, the Markov chain converges to the equilibrium distribution. The KL divergence values consistently decrease, indicating that the empirical distributions become increasingly similar to the equilibrium distribution as the number of samples increases. This behavior illustrates the fundamental property of Markov chains: they tend to reach a steady state over time, which is crucial for understanding their long-term dynamics."
